\# Roadmap



This roadmap tracks future work for Duna Orders. It is not a changelog and does not describe completed milestones.


\## High priority

### M4.2.6 — Parser-assisted draft creation

Status: next.

Use the parser output to help create draft orders from customer messages inside the current Streamlit pilot flow.

Planned slices:

1. M4.2.6a — Extract draft request factory logic. Closed.
2. M4.2.6b — Integrate parser-assisted draft creation into the New Order page. Next.

Reason:

M4.2.5b closed the tenant foundation. The next useful pilot milestone is turning natural customer messages into reviewable draft orders while keeping the operator in control.


\## Medium priority



\### Dashboard page



Add a read-only Streamlit dashboard.



Possible contents:



\- today's orders

\- total sales

\- recent confirmed orders

\- low-stock products

\- recent stock movements

\- parser warnings / failed parses



Reason:



Useful for pilots and demos. It makes the system's operational value visible beyond the order-entry page.



\### Customer registry workflow



Improve customer handling beyond free-text snapshots.



Possible scope:



\- customer search by phone

\- create/select customer from the New Order page

\- default address reuse

\- last order timestamp

\- customer notes



Reason:



Current order workflow supports customer snapshots, but a pilot business may need recurring customer handling.



\## Low priority / cleanup




\### Idempotent cleanup at live test session start



Live Sheets tests currently clean up rows at session end.



Add optional session-start cleanup for rows with known test prefixes.



Reason:



If a live test process crashes before teardown, orphaned `test\_run\_\*` rows can remain in the test spreadsheet. They are isolated by unique prefixes, but start-of-session cleanup would improve hygiene.



\### Storage exception consolidation



Replace raw built-in exceptions with storage-specific exceptions.



Possible mapping:



\- duplicate IDs: `StorageDuplicateIDError(StorageError)`

\- missing IDs: `StorageNotFoundError(StorageError)`



Reason:



Current behavior intentionally matches both backends:



\- duplicate customer/order/stock movement/parse log IDs raise `ValueError`

\- unknown `order\_id` on `update\_order\_status` raises `KeyError`



This is acceptable for the MVP, but storage-specific exceptions would make service-layer error handling clearer later.



\## Future backend migration

## Recently closed

### M4.2.5b — Tenant foundation

Closed.

Completed scope:

- Added `tenant_id` to tenant-scoped domain and request models.
- Added catalog-level business metadata.
- Updated Google Sheets schema, serialization, and deserialization for tenant-aware storage.
- Migrated the live test spreadsheet.
- Verified deterministic tests, live Sheets tests, demo catalog seeding, and smoke checks.

Next milestone: M4.2.6.

\### Database-backed storage



Add a database backend that implements `StorageInterface`.



Possible backends:



\- SQLite for local single-client deployments

\- PostgreSQL for multi-client production deployments

\- Supabase if managed Postgres + auth becomes useful



Principle:



The migration should add a new storage backend, not rewrite services, parser logic, or UI workflow.



Expected shape:



```text

Services

→ StorageInterface

→ InMemoryStorage / GoogleSheetsStorage / FutureDatabaseStorage
